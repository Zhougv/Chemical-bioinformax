# Chemical-bioinformax
## Method
Molecular property prediction plays a crucial role in drug discovery and has significant real-world implications. In addition to the structural information encoded in molecular graph structures, the integration of biological and chemical information can provide a valuable complement to tasks such as property prediction versus interaction prediction. However, how to incorporate molecular biological and chemical information into molecular representations, remains a major existing challenge. We propose the CBInformax, a pre-training models by maximizing the mutual information between topological representations of biochemical information similarity networks and structural representations generated by molecular graph neural networks. This integration allows the molecular graph neural network to implicitly capture and express network-level information even when fine-tuning molecules with unknown intermolecular relationships, thereby increasing its utility in downstream tasks. Experimental results show that CBInformax achieves performance improvements, effectively connects structural and biochemical data, and provides comprehensive and robust molecular representations.

## Model
The terms "GNN_global" and "GNN_local" in the model directory are used for fine-tuning the tasks of DDI (Drug-Drug Interactions) and molecular property prediction, respectively.

## Data
The pretraining samples are provided in the "data" directory. For downstream tasks, the molecular property prediction task can be found at https://moleculenet.org/datasets-1, while the DDI prediction task is available at https://github.com/wan-Ying-Z/AMDE-master.
